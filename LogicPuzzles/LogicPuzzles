Long and Short

Problem: 

The Long and the Short of It:
Hereâ€™s a great logic puzzle for kids: Six neighborhood children (Leisha, Benito, Delia, Charlotte, Weldon, and Zina) were measured yesterday.
Weldon is taller than Delia but shorter than Zina.
Leisha is taller than Benito but shorter than Delia and Weldon.
Benito is not the shortest.
Can you put them in order of height from tallest to shortest?






Answer: 
The way I approached this prolem is first by labeling a x-axis from tallest to Shortest. Looking at the first fact Weldon is taller than Delia but shorter than Zina. So I ordered those three as such: Zina, Weldon, Delia. The next sentance states that Leisha is taller than Benito but shorter than Delia and Weldon. I then adjusted the order to look as such: Zina, Weldon, Delia, Leisha, Benito. The facts state that Benito is not the shortest this leaves Charlotte as the shortest.


Tallest ------------------------------------------------------------------- Shortest
                 Zina, Weldon, Delia, Leisha, Benito, Charlotte
